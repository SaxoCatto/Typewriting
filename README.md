# Typewriting
My scripts written in Bash. In case I want to troubleshoot things, or just have fun playing with the machine <-> OS.
Not all are runnable, for not all file systems are the same. Download what you need here and proof read it before executing it. I am a stranger to you.
## Setups
- Currently I am using Linux, which has a different file system with Windows.
- I will try to add context to the scripts. Heck, if my aim is too big, I might make a folder for it (I don't know how to write dependencies)
- I use dwm for window manager, so some might not work for other DE. Unlike the bandwidth.sh

## Aim
Mainly to master the terminal so far. And Bash is pretty much the same for all machines so might as well become proficient. Although some might want to change my sh to other things. Tldr: 
- Who cares? Shouldn't be maximizing this over important things like workflow or dependencies.
- Just get zsh. Bash usable.

## Deps
- ffmpeg: Just goated in general. For media processing, like record screen.
