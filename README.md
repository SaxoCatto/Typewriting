# Typewriting
My scripts written in Bash. In case I want to troubleshoot things, or just have fun with the file system -> OS.
Not all are runnable, for the file systems are different for some OS. Download what you need here and proof read it before executing it. For good practices.
# Setups
Currently I am using Linux, which has a different file system with Windows. The syntax is quite the same though, for Bash.
Furthermore, the scripts in there might have a context. Heck, if my aim is too big, I might make a folder for it (I don't know how to write dependencies)
And finally, my scripts are tested by my (janky) zsh in the local machine. Yes this might be "non POSIX compliant" but doesn't matter. ANd my hardware is sufficient so I won't change writing style, till it is utilized many times.

# Aim
Mainly to master the terminal so far. And Bash is pretty much the same for all machines so might as well become proficient. Although some might want to change my sh to other things. Tldr: 
- Fish is not great, and kinda cheating imo
- Zsh for the autosuggestion and highlighting. I am trying to set my interactive history up, but it kept breaking (mainly bcuz I want to clean my Home directory)
- Bash is the de facto, but not quite fast. And Zsh kinda powercrept it. Some elitist might even add "Bash is bloated".
- Dash is giga fast, but some features are lacking. This is for the "POSIX-compliant" idea, and for the sheer speed. Might consider if I got better
- St. From suckless, looks great, runs nicely, and I'm lazy. Don't know about X11 yet sooo till I am deep in the Abyss.

# Update
- I am deep in the Abyss. Time to optimize my workflow reeeeeee.
- I am not stuck in st though. Just use your thing, like Alacritty.
