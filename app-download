# Neofetch output, as of 14/2/2024
# Kernel: 6.7.4-arch1-1
# Shell: bash 5.2.26
# Terminal: alacritty
# CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 6800H with Radeon Graphics (16) @ 4.785GHz
# GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Mobile / Max-Q + AMD ATI Radeon 680M
# Essentials

- Wine
- Steam + proton???
- gvfs: Knowing that my file manager is Thunar, having gvfs is a great utility. Offers like trash can, some distinction for folders like Downloads, Pictures, ... albeit I will not feel it it Hyprland
- Nvchads: Check their website -> download. Simple UI + binding improvement for this bitchy editor.

==> Recommend to make a script. Purely bash-pilled. In case Wayland/Xorgs sugma.

Screenshot taker: yay -S swayshot
- Will pull grim and slurp as dependencies, and compile. Huh how bout i get the packages from git?
- Alternatives: Flameshot. Be not discouraged by terminal-based. just type flameshot gui
Media player: yay -S celluloid
- Quite nice and powerful enough for novice user -> powerhouse. There might be other better choices like ffmpeg, and something n curses upgraded (??ncp??)

DSP: unknown
- If Wayland/Hyprland is your choice, then easyeffects might not be it. (i will reconfig and daily this to verify)
- Else, easyeffects is the GOAT. Do remember it is only the GUI, the actual computing is Pipewire and lsp-plugins
==> yay -S pipewire lsp-plugins easyeffects
