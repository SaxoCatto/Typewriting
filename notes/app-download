# Neofetch output, as of 14/2/2024
## Kernel: 6.7.4-arch1-1
## Shell: bash 5.2.26
## Terminal: kitty

# Essentials

- Wine
- Steam + proton (can't remember full name)
- gvfs: Knowing that my file manager is Thunar, having gvfs is a great utility. Offers things like trash can, some distinction for folders like Downloads, Pictures, ... albeit I will not feel it it Hyprland
- Nvchads: Check their website -> download. Simple UI + binding improvement for this bitchy editor.

==> Recommend to make a script. Purely bash-pilled. In case Wayland/Xorgs sugma.
# Nice to haves: Prefer to write own script. If not I will write dependencies for some specific DE/WM. My bias is for Hyprland. As for dwm, I will write a script for all

## Screenshot taker: hyprshot in https://github.com/Gustash/Hyprshot
- Will pull grim and slurp as dependencies, and compile. Huh how bout i get the packages from git?
- Alternatives: 
+ Flameshot. Be not discouraged by terminal-based. just type flameshot gui
+ ShareX: doesnt work on my Hyprland session. But for others like Windows, then ez recorder too
+ Swayshot: doesn't seem to work in my config. Alas, try again with hyprshot

## Media player: yay -S celluloid
- Quite nice and powerful enough for novice user -> powerhouse. There might be other better choices like ffmpeg, and something n curses upgraded (??ncp??). Sucks for displaying images though (use imv for that)

## DSP: unknown
- If Wayland/Hyprland is your choice, then easyeffects might not be it. (i will reconfig and daily this to verify). NVM I FIXED IT LMAO https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/17v7a4e/setting_up_pipewire_on_hyprland/
- Else, easyeffects is the GOAT. Do remember it is only the GUI, the actual computing is Pipewire and lsp-plugins
==> yay -S pipewire lsp-plugins easyeffects wireplumber pipewire-pulse

## Language:
- fcixt5: great in general. but for my usecase, a bit buggy (when Segmentation Fault). my fix is that use exec-once in my hypr.conf
(update: the fcitx5 can have VN and US input, rmb to use Unikey instead of Keyboard - Vietnameses)
- ibus-bamboo: ez installation and use in Gnome and KDE?. Still, Light said I tricked him for doing this (skill issue). There should be one Github link to show how to. Or just AUR it.

## Notification:
- dunst: im just following orders. i havent have it all set up. It is quite lightweight so why not: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dunst

## Zip extract:
- File roller (aka archive manager): just works for all. yay -S file-roller

## Circuit design:
- Ltspice: legacy. Just works if want to check schematics. But it keeps having newer version than that of AUR???
- Kicad: yay -S kicad. Other than not as annoying and proprietary like Altium, Kicad can split itself to multiple apps for other fuctionalities.

## Content creation:
- Inkspace: recommended? vector based.
- Davinci: final video editor. But Im too bad to set it up.
- Audacity: for audio creation. good, but might have some problem from the makers instead of the app. so do use yay -S instead of downloading directly from them.

## Domaphone, Odin:
- To unlock root for phones. For Samsung phones at least. Not the only but works for Samsung S9

## Freegate:
- IP faker. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkZl7FBipXA he recommends it

## wf-recorder:
- To record screens. Why not OBS? kinda heavy. i only needed this for recording my progress
